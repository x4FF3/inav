# Flight controller hardware

The current focus is geared towards flight controller hardware that use the STM32F3, STM32F4, STM32F7 and legacy STM32F1 series processors. The core logic is separated from the hardware drivers, porting to other processors is possible.

### Boards based on F1 CPUs

These boards are not recommended for new setups. They are very limited in memory and don't support many features of the INAV. In general F1 boards are limited to only UBLOX GPS protocol, don't have BLHeli Passthrough, don't have LEDSTRIP, only support a few telemetries (LTM and maybe FrSky) etc.

### Boards based on F3/F4/F7 CPUs

These boards are powerfull and in general support everything INAV is capable of. Limitations are quite rare and are usually caused by hardware design issues.

### Recommended boards

These boards are well tested with INAV and are known to be of good quality and reliability.
